# Intro to TURF

TURF is a method to ...

## What GBK was doing before I helped

Tehy were using slow R code like losers!

# What I did

I made fast C++ code.  Let me show you how much faster it is! 

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(Rcpp)
library(microbenchmark)
# Compilation
sourceCpp("turf_rcpp.cpp")

# Load data
data <- as.matrix(read.csv("out_mat1_forSB.csv"))

# Run turf
result <- turf(data, j=5, keep = 10)


print(result)
system.time(result_og<- turf(data))
microbenchmark(
  turf(as.matrix(data), j=5),
  times=10
  )

turf(as.matrix(data), j=5)

```
