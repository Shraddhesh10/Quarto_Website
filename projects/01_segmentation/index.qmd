## Project Overview

Performed customer segmentation by applying PCA for dimensionality reduction followed by KMeans clustering. Explored cluster counts from 2 to 6 and evaluated the results using both the Elbow Method and silhouette scores to ensure well-separated groupings.The analysis uncovered distinct clusters characterized by differences in shopping habits, demographics, and financial behavior, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
